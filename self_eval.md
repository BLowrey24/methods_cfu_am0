# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods?
I feel fairly confident nothing to go crazy over I still need to work on my understanding of some technical vocab but other then that I understand
the code pretty well and don't seem to have much trouble with the execution.
- How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own?
I actually enjoyed writing my own methods and didnâ€™t find that really difficult at all.
- What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!)
I'd say the main question I have is what is the end goal for them and what will they eventually be used for on big projects
and how many there really are.
